# Generic OAuth2 Library for Business Central

Generic OAuth2 Library for Business Central is to acquire Access Token from Azure AD, Google, Facebook etc. OAuth is most commonly used authorization method across all platforms. Acquiring Access Token is a little difficult in Business Central, though there is a Codeunit called OAuth2 available in the system. To help the Business Central developers' community, I thought of creating this generic library for OAuth2, so that developers can use this in their applications.
